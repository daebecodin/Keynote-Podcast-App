# KeyNote Podcast App Backend
Keynote is a Podcast management system allowing you to store a collection of Podcasts,
episodes within each Podcast, and finally your KeyNote collection. Keynotes are segmented
transcripts from the Podcast Episode of your choosing. Keynotes consist of their name, an
audio and/or transcript file, your deeper understanding of the KeyNote, and finally the
starting and end times of the KeyNote.
